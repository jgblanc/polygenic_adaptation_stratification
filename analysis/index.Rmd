## Guaranteeing unbiasedness in selection tests based on polygenic scores

Link to manuscript: https://www.overleaf.com/project/5ff4eec3e5325e0db841f6eb 

## Introduction 

This website contains all the code used for the analysis.  

## Simulation Pipeline 

This pipline is written in snakemake. To run the entire simulation pipeline you simply need to swap in the correct snakefile.   

* `code/Snakefiles/4PopSplit/snakefile` is the correct file to run the 4 population toy model from figure 1  
* `code/Snakefiles/SimpleGrid/snakefile/Lat/snakefile` runs the stepping stone grid simulations, simulates a latitudinal gradient, and uses latitude as the test vector   
* `code/Snakefiles/SimpleGrid/snakefile/StratD/snakefile` runs the stepping stone grid simultations, simulates stratifcation along the diagonal, uses latitude as the test vector, and does a PGA test along latitude and longitude  

The detailed methods and results for each simulation can be found [here](Simulations_methods.html).  

The pages below explain the 5 major steps of the pipeline:  

* [Simulate Genotypes](Simulate_Genotypes.html) 
* Simulate Phenotypes 
* Project Test Vector 
* Run GWAS 
* Polygenic Adaptation Test
