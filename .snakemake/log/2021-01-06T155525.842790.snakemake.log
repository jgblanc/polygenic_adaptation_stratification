Error in rule format_VCF:
    jobid: 0
    output: output/Simulate_Genotypes/4PopSplit/header.txt
    shell:
        cat output/Simulate_Genotypes/4PopSplit/test.vcf | head -n6 > output/Simulate_Genotypes/4PopSplit/header.txt

Removing output files of failed job format_VCF since they might be corrupted:
output/Simulate_Genotypes/4PopSplit/header.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
