MissingOutputException in line 9 of /project2/jjberg/jgblanc/polygenic_adaptation_stratification/snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
output/Simulate_Genotypes/4PopSplit/V1/genos_1.vcf
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.

Removing output files of failed job simulate_genotypes_4popsplit since they might be corrupted:
output/Simulate_Genotypes/4PopSplit/V1/genos_0.vcf, output/Simulate_Genotypes/4PopSplit/V1/genos.pop
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
